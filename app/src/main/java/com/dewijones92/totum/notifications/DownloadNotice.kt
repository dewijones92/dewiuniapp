/**
 * Turns a stream of [DownloadEvent]s into what should be on screen.
 *
 * Pure and synchronous on purpose: this is where all the judgement lives — what counts as
 * a batch, when to forget finished work, how to aggregate progress — so it can be tested
 * on the JVM instead of by squinting at a phone. [DownloadNotifier] only renders.
 *
 * **One aggregate notification, not one per item.** AntennaPod and NewPipe both notify
 * per download, which is fine when every download is a deliberate tap. Totum
 * auto-downloads the audio of everything in the queue, so per-item notifications would
 * mean thirty notifications for one queued playlist. Aggregating is the difference
 * between a useful signal and something you'd mute within a day.
