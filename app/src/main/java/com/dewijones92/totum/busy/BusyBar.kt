/**
 * One thin indeterminate bar across the top of the app whenever something is loading.
 *
 * Dewi asked for a spinner "when ANYTHING is loading". The whole value is in distinguishing
 * *working* from *idle*, which is why the timing below matters as much as the bar itself:
 *
 * - **It waits [APPEAR_AFTER_MS] before appearing.** Most calls finish in tens of
 *   milliseconds, and a bar that flashed on every one would be noise the eye learns to
 *   ignore — the opposite of the goal.
 * - **Once shown it stays for [MIN_VISIBLE_MS].** Appearing and vanishing within a couple of
 *   frames reads as a glitch rather than as feedback.
 *
 * Drawn as an overlay rather than as a row, so nothing on screen moves when it appears.
