/**
 * Resolves the next video shortly before the current one ends, so the gap between tracks is
 * silence you do not hear.
 *
 * Videos resolve just-in-time, which is right — a queue of sixty would otherwise pre-extract
 * sixty URLs that expire before you reach them. But it meant the extraction happened *after* the
 * previous item finished, in the silence. Measured on a real device (0.1.201): a video ended at
 * 00:28:55 and the next did not start until 00:29:02, and the whole seven seconds was one
 * `extract … in 7187ms`.
 *
 * So: same just-in-time rule, moved a minute earlier. The work happens while something is still
 * playing, and the resolve that follows finds it already done.
 *
 * App-scoped rather than driven from a screen, for the same reason the advance is: it has to keep
 * working with the phone in a pocket, which is exactly when a seven-second gap is most annoying
 * and least explicable.
 *
 * @param nextUp what playing on would start, without starting it.
 * @param prefetch resolves and caches; must be cheap to call again and must never throw.
