/**
 * Three bars that dance while something plays, and rest when it is paused.
 *
 * A static glyph can say "this is the current item" but not "this is making sound right now",
 * which is the thing you actually want to spot in a long queue. Motion reads as alive in a way
 * a filled icon never does, and it distinguishes playing from paused without a second symbol.
 *
 * Drawn rather than shipped as an animated vector: three tweened floats and a Canvas is less
 * code than the equivalent AVD, scales to any size, and takes its colour from the caller so
 * the brand palette stays in one place.
 *
 * When paused the bars hold a low, even height rather than freezing mid-dance — a stopped
 * animation caught at a random moment looks like a rendering bug.
