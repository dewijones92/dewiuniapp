/**
 * How the downloads list is ordered.
 *
 * Dewi, 2026-08-07: *"sort by size, sort by other stuff etc etc etc"*. Size is the one that matters
 * most here and the one [MediaSort] cannot express: it orders by what a [MediaItem] knows, and an
 * item does not know how many bytes its file takes. Only a download does.
 *
 * So this **wraps** [MediaSort] rather than restating it. Every order that is about the item is
 * still the shared one — same comparators, same stable-sort behaviour for items with no date or
 * duration — and only the two that are about the FILE are new. Adding an option to `MediaSort`
 * makes it appear here automatically; nothing has to be kept in step by hand.
