/**
 * The player's backdrop, tinted by whatever is playing.
 *
 * Dewi, 2026-08-07, asked which redesign option was "more sexy" and this is the answer: the surface
 * takes its colour from the artwork, so a Novara episode and a tennis highlight no longer look
 * identical. It is what makes a player feel like a product rather than a screen.
 *
 * **One flag, because it cuts against a recorded decision.** `CLAUDE.md` says dynamic colour is OFF
 * by default so the tangerine/cyan brand is actually seen; that decision was about Material You
 * substituting the *wallpaper's* palette across the whole app, which is a different thing from one
 * screen tinting itself with the thing it is playing. Still, the brand is quieter here than
 * elsewhere. [SOURCE] is the single switch: set it to [BackdropSource.Brand] and the player uses a
 * fixed brand gradient instead, with nothing else to change.
 *
 * The gradient fades to the ordinary surface colour a third of the way down, so everything below —
 * description, comments, up-next — sits on the normal background and stays readable. A full-height
 * tint looks impressive in a screenshot and makes body text hard work.
