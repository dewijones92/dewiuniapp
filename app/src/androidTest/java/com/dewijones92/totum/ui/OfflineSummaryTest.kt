 * Dewi, 2026-08-02: *"I expect the gui / labels etc to be very very clear"*. Rendered rather
 * than unit-tested because the thing being checked IS the wording on screen — `OfflineReadiness`
 * already has the arithmetic covered on the JVM, and a test asserting the numbers again would
 * prove nothing about what a person actually reads.
 *
 * Runs on CI's emulator with the rest of `connectedDebugAndroidTest`.
