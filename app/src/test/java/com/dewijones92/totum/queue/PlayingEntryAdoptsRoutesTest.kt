/**
 * The entry that is PLAYING must pick up a better route when its item is queued again.
 *
 * Every other entry gets removed and re-added, so it naturally takes the fresh handle. The playing
 * one is deliberately exempt — moving it would interrupt playback — which meant it alone kept the
 * route it was created with for as long as it stayed current.
 *
 * Found on the emulator, 2026-08-02, and invisible from anywhere else: the torrent being listened
 * to went on pulling the video while the episodes either side of it in the same run had the
 * audio-only URL. The database told the story — one row's handle null, its neighbours' correct.
