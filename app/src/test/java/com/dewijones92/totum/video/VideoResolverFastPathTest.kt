/**
 * Extraction is what resolves a video; the player response only catches what extraction cannot.
 *
 * The ordering was briefly the other way round and is pinned here because reverting it was
 * evidence-driven, not a matter of taste. Report 0.1.312, from a real phone: asking YouTube
 * first took 15-37 SECONDS per resolve — every one paying for a QuickJS `n` solve, where the
 * emulator's URLs happened to need none — and nearly all thirteen of them ended in "Source
 * error / stream failed". Slower AND broken, against an extraction path that works.
 *
 * What the attempt left behind is still load-bearing: building a result straight from a player
 * response is what makes age-restricted videos play, once extraction has refused them.
