/**
 * The last-known contents of one video feed, so the app opens with something on screen.
 *
 * Podcast episodes have been persisted since the beginning; YouTube feed videos never were.
 * So every launch showed an empty Videos tab until the network answered — measured
 * 2026-07-31: `[place] videos entered … videos=0`, populated 1.2 seconds later. PipePipe shows
 * yesterday's feed instantly and refreshes behind it, which is the whole difference.
 *
 * **Deliberately NOT on [PlaylistItemColumns].** That contract exists to rebuild a
 * `PlayableItem` — it carries a playback handle and drops duration, view count, upload date
 * and the members-only flag, because the queue and history do not render them. A feed row
 * renders exactly those, and needs no handle (one is derived at play time). Sharing the
 * contract would mean either losing the metadata Dewi asked lists to show, or widening four
 * other tables that have no use for it.
