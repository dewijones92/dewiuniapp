 * Dewi, 2026-08-05: *"things like playback speed, brightness, volume booster settings should not
 * change until I deliberately change them in the GUI — no exceptions"*, and, asked whether speed
 * should be per-podcast or global: *"global please"*.
 *
 * It used to be keyed by `SourceId`, on the reasoning that a podcast you listen to at 1.5× and a
 * channel you watch at 1× should each resume at their own speed. That is a defensible feature and
 * it is not what was wanted: the visible effect is that the speed changes on its own every time the
 * queue moves to something from a different source, which is indistinguishable from a bug. One
 * value, changed only by [save], and [save] is only ever called from the speed control.
