/**
 * Whether the app evens out how loud things are.
 *
 * It used to be a level you picked — Off / Low / Medium / High / Max, in decibels of makeup gain.
 * Dewi replaced that himself on 2026-08-08, choosing *"Auto — make everything the same loudness"*
 * over keeping the fixed steps, and he was right for a reason worth writing down: **the number was
 * the problem.** Picking it by ear per item means routinely asking for more gain than the audio
 * needs, and gain you did not need is exactly what sounds squashed and over-driven. Measuring the
 * item and applying the difference cannot over-ask.
 *
 * So there is nothing to tune. [AUTO] brings a quiet podcast up a long way, leaves a normal one
 * almost alone, and never applies more than +20 dB — see [LoudnessBoost] for the whole design,
 * including why a hard cap is the distortion rather than the cure for it.

 *
 * It was keyed by `SourceId`, on the reasoning that a quietly recorded podcast could stay boosted
 * without shouting at you everywhere else. Same defensible idea as per-source speed, and the same
 * problem: the level then changes on its own every time the queue reaches a different source, which
 * from the outside is the app altering a setting nobody touched. One value, moved only by [save],
 * and [save] is only ever called from the boost control.
