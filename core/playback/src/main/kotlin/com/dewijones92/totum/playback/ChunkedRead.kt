 * How many bytes are still available from [position] — the arithmetic [ChunkedDataSource] got wrong.
 *
 * The two answers it can give come from quantities that are NOT the same thing, and conflating them
 * is what broke the tail of every stream:
 *
 * - **[requestedLength]** is what the caller asked for, already relative to [position].
 * - **[resourceLength]** is the size of the WHOLE resource — YouTube's `clen` parameter. Bytes
 *   remaining from a position partway through it is that minus the position.
 *
 * `clen` was read straight into "bytes remaining" (2026-08-06, 0.1.359 and every build back to the
 * ranged-fetch change). ExoPlayer restarts its loader at a non-zero byte offset on every seek AND
 * every time the load control pauses loading, so essentially every stream over-declared its length
 * by exactly the offset it resumed at — and then, having reached the true end of the resource,
 * still believed bytes were owed and asked for a range past it. Four consecutive videos in the same
 * report hard-stalled inside their last 45 seconds and never recovered.
 *
 * A pure function so the arithmetic is provable without Android: a real [androidx.media3.datasource.DataSpec]
 * needs an `android.net.Uri`, which a JVM test cannot make — the same reason [isExpiredStatus] is
 * split out from the cause-chain walk that uses it.
