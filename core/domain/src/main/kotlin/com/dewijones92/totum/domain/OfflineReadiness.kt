 * for it to work offline … I expect the gui / labels etc to be very very clear"*. The machinery
 * already did most of this; what was missing was any way to SEE it. A diagnostics report could
 * say `downloading=0; failed=4` while the app itself showed a subtle headphones glyph per row
 * and no answer at all to "is my queue ready?".

 * Pure, so the counting is unit-tested and the screen only has to render it.
