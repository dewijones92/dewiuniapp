/**
 * Picks the field that IS a magnet, rather than the one named like one.
 *
 * Verified against the live service 2026-08-01, and it is a trap worth naming: `magnetUrl` is NOT
 * a magnet — it is a Prowlarr download-proxy URL carrying the API key
 * (`http://prowlarr/1/download?apikey=…`) — while `guid` holds the actual `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:…`.
 * Preferring the obvious-sounding field hands the streaming server an HTTP address instead of a
 * magnet, and the failure looks like a broken server rather than a parsing mistake.
 *
 * So candidates are judged by their VALUE. A result with no magnet anywhere is dropped: a
 * `.torrent` behind an authenticated URL is not something the streaming server can fetch, so half
 * a result is worse than none.
