/**
 * Turns the files inside a torrent into something orderable and readable.
 *
 * A season pack is a folder of two dozen files with names like
 * `Show.Name.S01E03.1080p.BluRay.x264-GROUP.mkv`. Left alone they queue in whatever order the
 * torrent lists them — usually right, occasionally not — and every row in the queue reads like a
 * release string rather than an episode.
 *
 * So the season and episode numbers are parsed out. Deliberately conservative: this is a small
 * fragile thing sitting in front of a feature that must not break, so anything it cannot parse
 * confidently keeps its filename and its original position. A wrong episode label is worse than
 * no episode label, because the wrong one is believed.
