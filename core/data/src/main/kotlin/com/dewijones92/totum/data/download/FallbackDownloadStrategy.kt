/**
 * Tries [primary], and on a failure [shouldFallBack] recognises, tries [secondary] instead.
 *
 * The shape mirrors `FallbackSearchSource`, for the same reason: one path handles almost
 * everything, and a second exists for the cases the first cannot reach — here, the videos YouTube
 * serves to the signed-in app and refuses to yt-dlp. Novara's members-only uploads sat in Dewi's
 * queue for days as "asking again cannot help", correctly, because nothing was ever going to ask
 * differently (report 0.1.346).
 *
 * **Only the primary's progress is forwarded while it is trying.** A download that reports 40% and
 * then restarts from zero under a different mechanism would read as a broken download; the states
 * before a failure are dropped, so the fallback's attempt is the only one anyone sees.
