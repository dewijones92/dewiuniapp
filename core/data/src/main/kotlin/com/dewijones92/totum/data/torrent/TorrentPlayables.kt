/**
 * Turns a prepared torrent into ordinary queue items.
 *
 * This is where the whole feature becomes unified, and it is deliberately tiny. A season pack
 * comes out as a list of [PlayableItem]s exactly like a podcast feed's episodes or a channel's
 * videos, so "queue this season" is the SAME operation as "play all of this playlist" —
 * `PlaybackQueue.playAll(items, group)`, which already renders a group header and can remove the
 * group as a unit. Nothing above this function knows a torrent was involved.
 *
 * The handle is [PlayHandle.Podcast], which reads oddly and is right: that handle means "play
 * this URL directly", which is exactly what a TorrServer stream is. The alternative would be a
 * fourth `PlayHandle` whose routing, download strategy and playback path were identical to an
 * existing one — a distinction with no behaviour behind it, and the sort of thing the project's
 * first law exists to prevent.
