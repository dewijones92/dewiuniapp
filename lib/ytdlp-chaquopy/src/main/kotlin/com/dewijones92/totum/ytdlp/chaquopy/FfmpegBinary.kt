/**
 * Exposes the bundled ffmpeg **and ffprobe** (shipped as `libffmpeg.so` / `libffprobe.so`)
 * to yt-dlp.
 *
 * Under Android 14's W^X policy the only app-private place a binary stays
 * executable is `nativeLibraryDir`, where the installer extracts native libs —
 * but yt-dlp's `ffmpeg_location` needs a directory containing a file literally
 * named `ffmpeg`. So we symlink `<filesDir>/ffmpeg-bin/ffmpeg` at the extracted
 * `libffmpeg.so`: exec follows the link to the executable inode, and no binary
 * is ever written to app storage.
 *
 * ffprobe is linked into the SAME directory, because that is where yt-dlp looks for it —
 * `ffmpeg_location` names a directory, not a file. Without it the SponsorBlock
 * `ModifyChapters` postprocessor cannot read a duration and every audio download of a video
 * fails with "ffprobe not found", which is exactly what happened on Dewi's phone.
