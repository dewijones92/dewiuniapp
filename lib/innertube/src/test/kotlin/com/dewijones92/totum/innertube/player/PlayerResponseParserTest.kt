/**
 * Reading a real SABR-restricted player response.
 *
 * The fixture is a live `/player` response for a made-for-kids video, captured with the
 * android client on 2026-07-30 (IP and signatures scrubbed). It is the exact shape that
 * makes a 1080p video play at 360p, and the reason this parser keeps formats that have no
 * URL — every URL extractor throws those away, which is why the app currently believes such
 * a video simply IS 360p.
