 * needs a title, an author, a length and a thumbnail, and until now those only ever came from
 * yt-dlp — which is why the fast path could only ever *supplement* the slow one.

 * feature" is not a trade anyone asked for.
 *
 * Deliberately strict about what counts, because a description is free text and a loose rule
 * turns any "1:1 with the author" into a chapter:
 *  - the timestamp must START the line, which is how YouTube itself requires them
 *  - it needs a title after it, or there is nothing to show
 *  - the first one must be at zero, which is YouTube's own rule for a chaptered video, and
