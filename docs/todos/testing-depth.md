# Deeper testing: mutation, and multi-step scenarios

**Ask:** "maybe add things like mutation testing, and testing such as complex
multi-step scenario testing … up to you."

My honest read: **one of these earns its place now, the other doesn't yet.**

## Multi-step scenario tests — yes, do this

The bugs this session were *all* multi-step, and none would have been caught by the
unit tests that were passing:

- queue **hydration racing** an enqueue made at launch;
- an audio-only download **standing in for the video**, giving sound and a blank
  picture;
- the engine strategy **not stamping** the audio-only flag, re-opening a trap;
- the auto-play toggle hidden **behind the video gate**.

Every one needed *state built up over several actions*. So the gap is real and the
shape is clear: JVM-level scenario tests over the real seams with fakes at the edges —
"queue three things, restart, jump to the second, remove a group, advance twice, assert
the queue and cursor". Fast (no device), and exactly where the defects live. That's a
better investment than more unit tests.

A second tier worth having: a small number of **instrumented** journeys for the things
only a device shows (the Expat RSS bug, A/V desync, notification actions, fullscreen).

## Mutation testing — not yet

Pitest is the obvious tool and Kotlin/Android support is workable, but:

- it is slow enough to hurt the "gate green on every commit" loop;
- the modules where it would pay (`:core:data`, `:core:domain`) already have close
  coverage, and the recent defects were **integration** bugs, which mutation testing
  doesn't find;
- it would mostly tell us what we know — that Compose/Media3 glue is thinly covered by
  design (those modules are Kover-exempt and verified on-device).

Revisit if a *logic* bug slips through in a well-covered module — that's the signal
mutation testing is worth its runtime.

## Suggested order

1. A scenario-test harness in `:app` (fakes wired as in `FakeAppContainer`) plus the
   first few queue/download journeys.
2. Extend to cross-pillar journeys (playlist → queue → download → play → advance).
3. Only then consider Pitest on `:core:*`.
